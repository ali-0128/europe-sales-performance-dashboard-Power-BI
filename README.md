# 🚀 Europe Sales Performance Dashboard – Power BI
## 1. The Challenge & Objective
- This project addresses the critical need to transform a large, disorganized European retail sales dataset into an effective monitoring and decision-making system.
  
- The Challenge: The available data lacked a unified and clear view of annual trends, which complicated the process of identifying positive and negative performance drivers across sales channels and product lines.
  
- The Objective: To design a dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard capable of analyzing financial performance (Revenue, Cost, Profit) and identifying critical intervention opportunities across diverse European markets over a four-year period.

## 3. Key Insights & Actionable Findings
This dashboard goes beyond mere reporting, delivering specific, actionable insights:

- 🛍️ Profit Concentration: The dashboard demonstrated that Office Supplies and Household are the primary profit drivers, supporting a strategy to focus resources and investment on these core categories.
- 🌍 Geographical Strengths: Macedonia was clearly identified as the top contributor to overall profit, followed by Portugal and San Marino, guiding strategic focus towards high-performing regions.
- 🛒 Channel Dominance: Confirmation that Online Sales generate the vast majority of the profit (over 50%), justifying continued and expanded investment in digital channels.
